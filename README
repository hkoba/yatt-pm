YATT version 0.0.1
==================

  YATT is Yet Another Template Toolkit. Like PHP (and unlike HTML::Template),
  YATT translates each template into (executable) Perl package(class)
  so that you can define subs to build up your own abstraction architecture.
  
  This is pre-alpha release, just to avoid CPAN namespace purge.
  So, you might not find any usefull feature in this.

INSTALLATION

  Its all pure Perl, so its ok to put the .pm files in their appropriate
  local Perl subdirectories.

  The easiest way to install this distribution is using the standard build
  process for Perl modules:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install


SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

  After installing, you can find documentation for this module with
  the perldoc command.
